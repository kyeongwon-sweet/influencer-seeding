# AI Shared Status

This is the shared source of truth for Codex, Claude, and any other AI session working on this project.

Rules:
- Read this file before changing code, Sheets, DB, Apps Script, or deployment.
- Do not rely on memory alone. Verify from code, DB, Sheets, deployment, or live UI before making factual claims.
- Update this file after meaningful changes: code commit, deployment, data correction, Apps Script change, or policy decision.
- Do not write secrets, tokens, service-role keys, cookies, or private credentials here.
- If a claim was not verified in the current session, mark it as unverified.

  - status: Ready

## 2026-07-13 Dashboard Deploy

Reason:
- Deploy only the confirmed missing dashboard changes from `origin/main`, without including unrelated dirty local worktree changes from other AI sessions.

Committed changes:
- `web/app/api/monthly-goal/route.ts`
  - changed the monthly goal sheet tab GID to `[인지_쫀득바]` (`1224959784`).
- `web/app/monitoring/page.tsx`
  - changed the daily delta table header from `누적 조회수` to `조회수 증분`.
  - changed selected-post action label from `선택 종료` to `선택 보관 처리`.
  - added `선택 취소` to clear the current selection.

Verification:
- `npm.cmd test`: passed, 26 tests.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit --incremental false`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint`: still fails on pre-existing lint debt; this deploy did not attempt the broader lint cleanup.
- Vercel production alias verified as Ready on `https://influencer-seeding-8p9eteu5u-kwhwang-s-projects.vercel.app`.
- Live UI verified in logged-in Chrome:
  - `/home` shows `7월 목표 현황` and no longer shows `이달 목표 데이터를 불러오지 못했습니다.`
  - `/monitoring` daily delta table contains `조회수 증분` and no old `누적 조회수` table header.
  - Selecting one post shows `선택 보관 처리 (1)`, `선택 취소`, and no `선택 종료`.

## Monitoring Increment Policy

- First valid measurement counts as the full increment for that day.
  - Example: if a post first appears with 200,000 views on upload day, that day increment is 200,000.
- `safeIncrement` and display increment rules are the single source of truth for dashboard increment display.
- Do not switch dashboard display back to stored `increment` columns.
- Stored `post_daily_stats.increment` is vestigial for display and should not be used as the dashboard truth.
- "Today" is treated carefully because same-day collection can be incomplete.
- Overnight KST collection should be attributed to the intended monitoring date, not blindly to the runtime date.

## Upload-Date / Measurement-Date Policy

- A measured date before a post's upload date is invalid.
- Invalid pre-upload stats must not be stored.
- Invalid pre-upload stats must not be exported to the linked Sheet.
- Dashboard display API must ignore pre-upload stats even if old polluted rows remain in DB.

Current code guards:
- `scripts/run_monitoring.py`
  - skips posts whose `posted_at` is after `TODAY`
  - rejects Apify IG responses whose shortcode was not requested
  - rejects Apify IG responses whose response `posted_at` differs from DB/sheet `posted_at` by more than 1 day
- `web/app/api/monitoring/collect-now/route.ts`
  - same requested-shortcode and posted-date mismatch guards
- `web/app/api/apify-webhook/route.ts`
  - skips pre-upload posts
  - ignores non-requested IG response keys
  - rejects posted-date mismatch greater than 1 day
- `web/app/api/sponsored-posts/route.ts`
  - filters pre-upload stats before dashboard latest/all_stats calculations
- `web/app/api/sponsored-posts/stats-import/route.ts`
  - rejects sheet-import stats before upload date
- `web/app/api/sponsored-posts/stats-for-sheet/route.ts`
  - drops pre-upload stats when exporting DB stats to sheet

## 2026-07-13 Data Correction

Reason:
- Some automatic/API collection or later import propagation attached wrong positive cumulative values to posts.
- Example observed: Chubeureup rows had Abapnam values; Promseohee IG/TT had large overcounts.
- `manual=true` alone is not reliable source evidence because later Sheet import can mark already-existing rows manual.

Verified correction source:
- Jjondeuk dashboard memo notes in spreadsheet `1EITk9hxHPhJ07xvOlVL9kOdZXhthupRwfJLpIqIou2s`, tab `인지_쫀득바`, cells `V106:V110`.

DB cleanup:
- Deleted 8 `post_daily_stats` rows where `measured_at < sponsored_posts.posted_at`.
- Readback after deletion: `pre_posted_count: 0`.

Linked Sheet corrections:
- Spreadsheet: `10WpAQU9TAsi3hRZ3ELvcQYj7Z228ILXfF6BUGz495Ak`
- Tab: `콘텐츠 대시보드 연동`
- Verified date columns:

- Corrected rows:
  - `아밥남` row 696
  - `츄베릅` row 810
  - `프롬서희(IG)` row 811
  - `프롬서희(TT)` row 812
- Verified readback:
  - `츄베릅`: `7/7 blank`, `7/8~7/12 = 65,128 / 154,478 / 169,020 / 173,517 / 183,169`
  - `프롬서희(IG)`: `7/7~7/8 blank`, `7/9~7/12 = 33,788 / 38,687 / 39,675 / 42,219`
  - `프롬서희(TT)`: `7/7~7/8 blank`, `7/9~7/12 = 54,400 / 83,600 / 84,100 / 84,800`
  - `셍이`, `복득이`, `새로미`: upload-before cells blank and values match DB/memo.

## Latest Apps Script

- Current latest Apps Script file referenced by user:
  - `C:\Users\hwangkw\AI\.claude\wt-company\Combined_Sheet_AppsScript.gs`
- Git-tracked Apps Script canonical file:
  - `Combined_Sheet_AppsScript.gs`
  - Synced from the user-referenced latest file on 2026-07-13 so the upload-date guards are not only in a local worktree.
- Policy expected in Apps Script:
  - `exportStats`: never fill cells before upload date.
  - `exportStats`: may forward-fill only after upload date and only for missing measurement display.
  - `importStats`: never import stats before upload date.
  - `importStats`: do not re-import forward-filled carry values as fake new measurements.

## Claude / Codex Shared Entry Points

- `.claude/skills/influencer-seeding/SKILL.md` must instruct Claude to read this file first.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AI_SKILLS.md` also point to this file.
- Personal AI memory is background/history only. It must not override this shared status file.

## Known Issues / Not Yet Verified

(none open — advertising-cost duplicate issue resolved below.)

## 2026-07-13 Advertising-cost duplicate recheck — RESOLVED (no systematic bug)

Rechecked by Claude against DB `sponsored_posts` (839 posts) + user confirmation. Conclusion: **no systematic advertising-cost duplication.** Do not mass-delete/adjust cost.

- Same-cost-repeated groups are overwhelmingly legitimate:
  - Viral accounts (e.g. good_tip_magazine 250k×32, bibimbap 300k×17, luna.humor 250k×19) post many separate pieces at a flat per-post rate — each a real cost, not a duplicate.
  - Different-product campaigns by the same creator = separate deals (오하루 JD멜/P혼, 지지야먹자 JD망/JD멜, 와뜨기, 여원맛집, 골목대장, 오홀). User confirmed.
  - Contract fees intentionally split across platforms are correct (톡톡시아 833,333×3 = 2.5M/3, 준맛 633,333×3 = 1.9M/3).
- Cross-platform same-product/same-date full-fee entries are **intended per-platform costs, not duplicates** — user confirmed for 뭐랭하맨 (5.7M ×2 IG+YT, DB딸, 05-22) and for the remaining group (시으니네 1.1M×2, 프롬서희 1.0M×2, 라밍 500k×3, 류라이 400k×2, 포슬 100k×2).
- Naive heuristic "base account + same cost" over-counted ~85M (31.6%) and is invalid — ignore it.

No data changed. Cost values left as-is.

## Verification Completed For Commit 29923f9

- `py_compile` for `scripts/run_monitoring.py`: passed
- `npm.cmd test`: 26 tests passed
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit --incremental false`: passed
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed after elevated permission for `.next`
- pre-push `tsc --noEmit`: passed
- `git push origin HEAD:main`: succeeded
- Vercel production alias: Ready and points to the new deployment

Not fully verified:
- Direct unauthenticated fetch to `/api/sponsored-posts` returned 404 HTML.
- Direct fetch to `/api/sponsored-posts/stats-for-sheet` with local secret returned 401.
- Therefore live protected dashboard UI/API readback was not completed through a logged-in browser in that session.

## Working Etiquette For AI Sessions

- Before code changes:
  - read this file
  - inspect current git status
  - inspect relevant code
  - decide whether the change is still correct before editing
- After code changes:
  - run relevant tests/build
  - verify actual downstream surface when feasible
  - update this file
  - commit only intended files
- For data changes:
  - dry-run first
  - write only verified target rows/cells
  - read back exact rows/cells afterward
  - record what changed here
